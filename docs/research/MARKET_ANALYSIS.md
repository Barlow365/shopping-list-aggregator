## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### Gap 1: Budget Awareness

**Problem:**
- Existing list apps don't track budgets
- Budgeting apps don't integrate with shopping

**Opportunity:**
- Be the first to combine list + budget in one tool
- Live "Estimated Total" as items are added
- Priority-driven budget decisions

### Gap 2: Multi-Store Aggregation

**Problem:**
- Lists are store-specific OR generic
- No app shows "same list, filtered by store"

**Opportunity:**
- One list, multiple views (by store, tag, priority)
- Smart routing: "Buy these at Kroger, those at Target"

### Gap 3: Group Buying

**Problem:**
- Group buying exists for e-commerce (Groupon)
- No app enables household-to-household pooling

**Opportunity:**
- Neighborhood shopping co-ops
- One person shops for 3-5 households
- Auto-calculate cost splits

### Gap 4: Receipt Intelligence

**Problem:**
- Receipt scanning exists, but not integrated with lists
- No app learns prices and improves estimates

**Opportunity:**
- OCR + price learning = smarter budgets
- "Last time you paid $4.50 for milk, now it's $4.79"
